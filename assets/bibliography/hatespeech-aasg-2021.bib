    abstract = "This paper envisions a multi-agent system for detecting the presence of hate speech in online social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. We introduce a novel framework employing deep learning techniques to coordinate the channels of textual and image processing. Our experimental results aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods for classifying online content, training the proposed neural network model to effectively detect hateful instances in the input. We conclude with a discussion of how our system may be of use to provide recommendations to users who are managing online social networks, showcasing the immense potential of intelligent multi-agent systems towards delivering social good.",
